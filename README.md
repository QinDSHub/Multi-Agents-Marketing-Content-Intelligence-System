# MULTI_AGENTS Content Intellgience System

Multi-agent workflow built with LangGraph for researching industry reports, extracting insights, ranking them, generating marketing content, and optionally distributing posts to Facebook.

## What this project does

- Searches the web for relevant industry reports.
- Builds a vector retriever and summarizes insights (map -> reduce -> rank).
- Generates publishable marketing content from ranked insights.
- Supports a manual review gate before automated distribution.

## Architecture

Nodes are defined in [src/agent/graph.py](src/agent/graph.py):

1. research: search and build retriever
2. map: extract raw insights
3. reduce: synthesize strategic insights
4. rank: score and order insights
5. content_generator: generate marketing content
6. distributor: post to Facebook (optional, gated)

## Setup

### Install

```bash
cd d:/projects/6_multi_agents_optimized
pip install -e . "langgraph-cli[inmem]"
```

### Environment variables

Create a .env file in the project root:

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1

# Optional if you integrate Tavily later
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_key
TAVILY_BASE_URL=https://api.tavily.com
```

### Run the LangGraph server

```bash
langgraph dev
```

### Run locally (example)

```bash
python -m agent.graph
```

You will see a manual confirmation prompt before any distribution action.

## Quickstart (sample inputs)

The default demo values are in [src/agent/graph.py](src/agent/graph.py). You can change them directly or pass a custom state when running in a script.

Example state values you can use:

```python
initial_state = {
	"company": "OpenAI",
	"year": "2025",
	"period": "full year",
	"steps": [],
	# Optional for distribution:
	# "page_id": "YOUR_FACEBOOK_PAGE_ID",
	# "fb_access_token": "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
}
```

If you set `page_id` and `fb_access_token`, the distributor node can post after you confirm.

## Troubleshooting

- Search returns empty results: Google HTML can change or rate limit. Try again later or swap in a paid search API.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` missing: ensure your .env is in the project root and `dotenv` loads it.
- `No data retrieved from search`: verify search results are non-empty and the network is available.
- Facebook post fails: confirm `page_id` and `fb_access_token` are valid and have publish permissions.
- Cache conflicts: delete the `.agent_cache` folder to reset cached outputs.

## Notes

- The search utility uses Google HTML parsing and can be rate limited. For production, consider a dedicated search API.
- Retriever building stores embeddings in memory for each run.
- Simple disk caching is used in .agent_cache for map/reduce/rank results.

## Project structure

- [src/agent/graph.py](src/agent/graph.py): graph definition and entry point
- [src/agent/services/multi_agents.py](src/agent/services/multi_agents.py): LLM agents and Facebook distributor
- [src/agent/services/rag.py](src/agent/services/rag.py): retrieval helpers
- [src/agent/services/tools.py](src/agent/services/tools.py): search helper
- [src/agent/services/utils.py](src/agent/services/utils.py): cache helpers
- [src/agent/services/schemas.py](src/agent/services/schemas.py): pydantic models

## Safety

This project includes a manual confirmation step before publishing to social media. Ensure your access tokens and page IDs are stored securely.

## GenAI Assistance Disclosure

This multi-agent automation using LangChain and LangGraph was developed by me and refined with the assistance of GPT-5.2-Codex, which contributed to code optimization, language polishing, and prompt iteration. All system architecture, implementation, and final outputs were independently created and validated by the author, who assumes full responsibility for the project’s academic integrity.
