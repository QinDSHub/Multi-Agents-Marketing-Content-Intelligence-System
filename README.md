# A Multi-Agent Intelligent Marketing System Based on LangChain and LangGraph

This repository presents Version 3.0 of a multi-agent intelligent marketing system that implements a closed-loop, end-to-end automation pipeline for marketing intelligence and content operations. The system integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), structured multi-agent orchestration, and human-in-the-loop (HITL) validation to support reliable insight extraction, content generation, automated publishing, and post-publication performance analysis.

Built upon LangChain and LangGraph, the proposed architecture emphasizes modularity, grounding, and extensibility, enabling controlled large language model (LLM) deployment in real-world marketing workflows. Compared with earlier versions, this iteration focuses on architectural optimization, explicit agent responsibility boundaries, and improved reproducibility.

## System Overview

The proposed system adopts a sequential multi-agent architecture, in which each agent is responsible for a well-defined stage in the marketing intelligence lifecycle. Agents communicate via structured outputs validated by Pydantic schemas, ensuring consistency and robustness across the pipeline.

The complete workflow forms a closed feedback loop, beginning with external and internal knowledge acquisition and ending with automated performance evaluation to support iterative strategy refinement.

## Agent Architecture and Pipeline
### **Search Agent**

The Search Agent retrieves professional and industry-grade textual sources to ground downstream reasoning and mitigate hallucination risks in LLM-generated outputs.

External information is collected using Google SerpAPI.

Retrieved documents serve as authoritative references for subsequent retrieval and generation tasks.

### **Search Document Loader Agent**

This agent extracts raw textual content from URLs provided by the Search Agent and applies standardized preprocessing procedures, including text cleaning, normalization, and noise removal.

### **Local Document Loader Agent**

To support domain-specific and proprietary knowledge integration, the Local Document Loader Agent enables users to upload PDF documents from local storage. These documents undergo the same preprocessing pipeline as externally sourced materials, ensuring uniform representation.

### **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Agent**

The RAG Agent implements a Map–Reduce-style retrieval framework:

Map Phase

Document chunking and embedding

Vector storage using a temporary Chroma database

Sources include both online documents and locally uploaded files

Reduce Phase

Semantic retrieval and ranking of the most relevant document chunks in response to user queries

This design grounds LLM reasoning in retrieved evidence and improves factual consistency.

### **Insights Agent**

The Insights Agent synthesizes retrieved information into a concise set of five high-level, actionable insights. These insights function as an intermediate semantic abstraction layer, decoupling knowledge retrieval from content generation.

### **Content Generation Agent**

The Content Generation Agent produces publication-ready marketing content using strictly structured outputs defined via Pydantic schemas. The output schema includes:

Insight identifier linkage

Content format specification (e.g., article, blog, case study)

Headline and full textual body

Call-to-action and target audience definition

Recommended distribution channels

Explicit source references

While the current implementation focuses on text generation, the architecture supports future extensions to multimodal generation (e.g., video scripts, visual assets) and multilingual content production via additional agents.

### **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**

To ensure quality control and ethical deployment, a Human-in-the-Loop mechanism is incorporated. Generated content undergoes manual review, validation, and optional revision before publication, ensuring alignment with organizational standards.

### **Auto Publish Agent**

The Auto Publish Agent schedules and disseminates approved content across social media or marketing platforms.

A Facebook API integration is provided as a reference implementation.

The design is platform-agnostic and supports extensibility.

### **Auto Analysis Report Agent**

Following publication, the Auto Analysis Report Agent generates analytical summaries evaluating engagement metrics, effectiveness, and return on investment (ROI). These reports enable data-driven optimization of future marketing strategies, closing the system feedback loop.

## Design Principles

The system is guided by the following design principles:

Modularity: Each agent is independently extensible and replaceable

Grounded Generation: RAG is employed to constrain LLM outputs to retrieved evidence

Structured Communication: Pydantic schemas enforce data consistency across agents

Human Oversight: HITL safeguards are integrated at critical decision points

Version 3.0 prioritizes architectural clarity and experimental reproducibility. Production-level optimizations such as asynchronous execution, caching, and persistent long-term memory are intentionally excluded to maintain research focus.
